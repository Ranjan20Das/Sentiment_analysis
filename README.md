# 📊 Sentiment Analysis

This project implements **Sentiment Analysis** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The aim is to classify text reviews into **positive** or **negative** sentiments by applying preprocessing, feature extraction, and ML models.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF / Bag of Words**
- Sentiment classification using ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Visualizations with **matplotlib & seaborn**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy, Pandas** → Data handling
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** → ML models & evaluation
- **NLTK / TextBlob** → NLP preprocessing
